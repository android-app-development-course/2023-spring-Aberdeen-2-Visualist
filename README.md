 

## 1. Project Overview

The main function of "Visualist" is to improve users' photography skills and aesthetics, so that customers can take more beautiful photos.

The main function of "Visualist" is to compare expert photos. After users upload their photos, the App recognizes the content, scene, light, person or object, and returns an expert photo taken in a similar scene, along with some expert suggestions. Users can improve their shooting skills by comparing their photos with expert pictures and expert suggestions provided by the App.

The Visualist also has some other functions, such as forum function and mall function. This is the main way the App monetizes.

 

## 2. User analytics

Visualist is aimed at people who want to take good looking photos and people who want to improve their photography. Our main users are young people.

### 2.1 User pain points 

These users have many pain points, of which two are the main ones. One is that they have no professional technology, and the other is that they have no professional equipment.

1. Awareness without technology: Professional shooting technology needs to be systematically studied and trained to master, if you have not learned the relevant knowledge, do not realize what technical and theoretical support good photos need, it is difficult to take high-quality photos. For example, mastering the skills of focusing, exposure, composition and so on can better grasp the moment, show the picture, highlight the theme and so on.
2. No professional equipment: although the current mobile phone camera performance is more and more powerful, but compared with professional photography equipment, there is still a certain gap. Lack of professional photography equipment, such as SLR, tripod, etc., will also affect the quality and effect of photography, such as in low light environment may appear noise or blur and so on

In short, if you want to take good photos, you need to have a certain amount of professional knowledge and technology, as well as high-quality equipment. However, good photography is not only about equipment and technology, but also needs artistic and aesthetic absorption, and needs to have a unique visual understanding and experience.

To solve these problems, users need to do the following things.

1. Learn professional knowledge and techniques: Understand the basic principles and techniques of photography, master the skills of focusing, exposure, composition, etc., by attending offline or online photography training, or by self-learning related knowledge and theories, such as obtaining professional knowledge through photography books, video tutorials, etc.
2. Practice shooting skills: Practice and practice, through the actual shooting process, you can gradually master shooting skills and improve photography. At the same time, you can also learn about the industry dynamics and get professional feedback by participating in photography competitions, sharing works and other ways.
3. Switch to professional equipment: If you want to shoot more professional photography, you can choose to buy professional photography equipment, such as SLR cameras, lenses, tripods, etc. However, before purchasing, we should fully understand and carefully compare, consider the actual needs of individuals, and weigh the cost performance and practicability of the equipment.
4. Enhance aesthetic and artistic absorption: Taking good photos and having artistic temperament of the photos are not necessarily the same, need to enhance aesthetic and artistic absorption, improve the unique visual understanding and experience, so as to better understand the work taken. You can look at other photographic works to understand different shooting angles and methods of expression.

In short, taking high-quality photos requires continuous learning and practice, as well as continuous acquisition of more technical and aesthetic knowledge. On this basis, the configuration of appropriate photographic equipment, in different scenes, can better achieve the purpose of shooting, there are higher quality works.

However, these requirements, "Visualist" can provide users with help.

### 2.2 Visualist

1. Learn excellent photography skills: Imitating master photography can learn master's excellent photography skills and shooting methods, so as to better master photography knowledge and skills. For example, imitating how masters compose, judge the light, capture the moment, etc., you can quickly master the skills, and use them freely in actual shooting.
2. Broaden your vision and expand your imagination: By imitating the master, you can broaden your vision, understand different styles and shooting ideas, improve your aesthetic and artistic quality, and stimulate your creativity and imagination.

4. Step out of your comfort zone: Imitating a master allows you to better step out of your comfort zone and challenge your abilities and creativity, thus further improving your shooting ability and level.

In short, by imitating the master shooting, you can better master photography skills, improve your artistic literacy and personality style, so as to constantly improve your photography level. In addition, in the process of imitation, you can also continue to learn the shooting ideas and styles of other photographers, appropriately add your own personality characteristics, and constantly innovate and break through, in order to better improve your photography level.

##### Now, the photography industry is gradually refining consumer groups to meet the individual needs of customers. 

Conventional and universal services are difficult to operate. Only by catering to the individual needs of consumer groups can they be favored by consumers. The following are the main reasons.

1. Changes in market demand: As the market becomes increasingly competitive, consumer demand in the photography market is gradually becoming diversified and personalized. Consumer groups have different needs and pursuits for the object, scene, style and form of photography.
2. Driven by the development of technology: With the continuous development of technology, the technical threshold of the photography industry continues to rise. Photography practitioners can provide more refined and personalized services by following up on the latest technology.

2. Improve the value of the product: the increase in the added value of the product means the improvement of the quality of the product, which will improve the recognition and value of the product, and become one of the reasons for consumer choice.
3. Expand the sales channel: the provision of additional services can expand the sales channel of the product, make the product more attractive and develop new market demand.

### 3.2 Risks 

However, the photography industry is also gradually maturing, and the market competition is becoming more and more fierce.

 

##### High operating cost and low profit margin 

At present, there are more and more offline physical stores, and the competition is becoming more and more fierce, leading to the decline of service prices. While the rent of stores in cities is getting higher and higher, labor costs are becoming more and more expensive, and the cost of photography industry is rising. Under the influence of these two factors, more and more offline physical stores are not well managed and facing closure. The following are the main reasons.

First, the market is highly competitive. If the competition in the product market is fierce, the enterprise may need to increase the investment in marketing planning to gain more market share. At this time, the enterprise's marketing expenses are relatively high, which leads to the increase of operating costs and the decrease of profits.

At the same time, the price of raw materials. If the price of raw materials goes up, it will lead to an increase in production costs, which will eventually lead to an increase in operating costs.

In addition, labor costs go up. If enterprises invest more in labor costs, such as salary, insurance and welfare, it will also lead to an increase in operating costs.

There is also the aging of production equipment. If the production process and equipment used by the enterprise are relatively old, it may require relatively high maintenance and repair costs, which will also lead to higher operating costs of the enterprise.

 

##### Fierce regional competition 

In the investigation of Shishan Town, Nanhai District, Foshan City, it was found that in a region, the number of offline stores of photography service basically remained in a stable state, and the market supply and demand were close to saturation. In this case, there is an incompatibility between water and fire among the physical stores. Here are the main reasons.

1. Low barriers to entry: The photography industry has relatively low barriers to entry, and many people can be self-taught to enter the industry through study and practice. This leads to a lot of practitioners competing in the market, especially in a niche like wedding photography, where the competition can be even more intense
2. Technological innovation: With the development of science and technology, photography technology is constantly updated and innovated. This has become the motivation for many practitioners to continue to learn and progress, but it also leads to the lowering of the threshold of the photography industry and the intensification of competition.
3. Price war: thousands of photographic practitioners and photographic agencies compete in price, which makes many people gradually ignore other aspects of photographic service quality and service characteristics, and constantly reduce prices to obtain the commanding heights, resulting in an increasingly fierce market price war.
4. Market segmentation: in the case of market segmentation such as wedding photography, baby photography, and travel photography, many practitioners will compete with other practitioners in their fields of expertise, leading to fierce market competition.
5. The importance of customer word of mouth: the customer word of mouth in the photography industry has a very large impact on practitioners. Such as bad word of mouth or low evaluation, may lead to the loss of customers or unable to recruit new customers, which makes practitioners pay more attention to service quality and service experience.

In general, there are various reasons for the fierce competition in the market area. Due to the low threshold, fast technological update, market segmentation and other reasons, the competition in the photography industry is becoming increasingly fierce, which also requires practitioners to improve their own strength and service quality, and enhance competitiveness.

 

##### Lack of online promotion experience and awareness of online marketing 

Traditional photography services are carried out offline, which is why the number of customers grows slowly. Here are the main reasons.

1. Traditional marketing thinking: Since the photography industry is a traditional entity industry, many practitioners rely less on online marketing, and traditional marketing thinking may still dominate, which leads to a lack of experience in online promotion.
2. Company scale: many photography agencies or practitioners are small in scale and lack resources to carry out more comprehensive and long-term online promotion, which also causes the relative weakening of online marketing awareness.
3. Lack of professional skills and knowledge: many photography practitioners lack enough professional skills and knowledge on how to carry out online promotion and how to choose the right social media and online promotion tools, which leads to relatively weak experience in online promotion.

The consequence of the weak experience in online promotion and insufficient awareness of online marketing in the photography industry is that under the current trend of rapid development of digital sharing platforms, photography companies and practitioners will lose the opportunity to promote themselves on online platforms, and many potential customers may miss out on suitable photography services because they cannot find photography agencies. At the same time, photography agencies or practitioners lag behind the industry trend, will not be able to adapt to the fast-paced competition in the market environment.

##### Lack of brand influence 

There are few influential brands in the photography industry, and most of them are ignored. The following are the main reasons.

1. Product homogeneity: The photography industry has a serious product homogeneity, and it is difficult to obtain a memorable and lasting impression through product differentiation and characteristics, which is also difficult to establish brand influence.
2. Lack of creativity: Creativity and innovation ability is the key to establish brand influence. However, the photography industry currently has many practitioners whose photography works lack unique design, and annual events are often repetitive, which also leads to a lack of brand influence.
3. Lack of publicity: The publicity related to the brand is insufficient in the industry, unable to form enough brand advantages and let more people know about the brand, and lack of enough promotion channels, unable to quickly build brand exposure and fans.

The consequence of the lack of brand influence in the photography industry is that in the face of market competition, photography practitioners are difficult to form uniqueness or enhance brand competitiveness, difficult to attract the attention of high-value customers, affecting the long-term development of enterprises and business scale expansion.
